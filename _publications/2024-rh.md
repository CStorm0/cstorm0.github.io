The phase behavior of rhodium (Rh) metal has been studied to 191 GPa and 2700 K using a combination of room-temperature isothermal compression and double-sided flash laser heating experiments. The isothermal compression data have been fitted with a second-order adapted polynomial of order L equation of state (EoS) with best-fitting parameters of V0 = 13.764(2) Å3/atom, K0 = 258(3) GPa, and K′ = 5.36(9). Two- dimensional maps of the uniaxial stress component t are presented for Rh at different pressures showing the spatial distribution of the local stress state of a relatively high-yield strength material encased in a Bi pressure medium. In addition, a simple, thermal pressure equation-of-state model, based on a single Einstein temperature, has been fitted to the high-pressure-temperature data up to 2700 K at 148 GPa and ambient- pressure thermal expansion data up to 1982 K. Also determined are the best-fitting parameters to reproduce the thermal EoS within the DIOPTAS two-dimensional integration software. The optimized DIOPTAS parameters are V0 = 13.764 Å3/atom, K0 = 260.54 GPa, K′ = 5.114, αT = 2.99 × 10−5 K−1, ∂αT /∂T = 1.27 × 10−9 K−2, ∂K0/∂T = −6.43 × 10−5 GPa/K, and ∂K′/∂T = −9.3 × 10−10 K−1.
