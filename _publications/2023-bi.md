We have conducted diffraction studies of bismuth (Bi) to 298 GPa using both conventional and toroidal diamond anvil cells (DACs) to investigate its suitability as a pressure-transmitting medium (PTM) to such pressures. Using microfocused x-ray beams, we have determined the pressure dependence of the uniaxial stress component (t) in cubic Bi-V from 7 to 298 GPa and find that at 298 GPa, t , 0:5 GPa. Bi-V, therefore, cannot support significant shear stresses, making it an excellent PTM. We have also measured the compressibility of Bi-V against that of copper (Cu) and gold (Au), allowing it to be used as a pressure marker as well as a PTM.
