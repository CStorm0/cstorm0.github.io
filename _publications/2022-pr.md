Angle-dispersive x-ray powder diffraction experiments have been performed on praseodymium metal to a pressure of 205 GPa. Between 20 and 165 GPa only the oC4 (α-uranium) phase is observed, in agreement with previous studies. At 171(5) GPa we find a transition to a tetragonal tI2 phase which is isostructural with the high-pressure post-oC4 phase seen in the neighboring lanthanide cerium above 12 GPa, and with the high- pressure phase of the actinide thorium seen above 100 GPa. Electronic structure calculations determine the oC4 → tI2 transition to occur at 130 GPa at 0 K, but find another phase, with the hP1 (simple hexagonal) structure, to have a lower enthalpy than both the oC4 and tI2 structures above 20 GPa at 0 K.
